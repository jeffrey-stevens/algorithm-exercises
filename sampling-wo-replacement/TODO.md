## Enhancements

* Make the distribution of random numbers truely uniform.
* Give option for running the dummy Criterion tests.


## Features

* Testing and debugging
  * Logging in debug mode
  * Traces of random number selection
* Make sampling-wo-replacement into a shared library
* Make sampling-wo-replacement into a command
  * Sample size, sample range, random seed, outfile as arguments
  * Output one integer per line


## Tests

* Set up mechanism for testing internal functions
* Check the randomness of the samplings


## Other functions

* Hash table implementation of gen_samples()
